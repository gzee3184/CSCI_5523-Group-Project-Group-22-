PERSONID|Individual identification number|Technical|PERSONID is an identification variable constructed by IPUMS using the reference ID variable (REFID) from the public use files.  The original variable identifying individuals uniquely across samples is composed of alpha-numerics, whereas PERSONID used an algorithm to create unique numeric values for each individual.  Each digit was expanded to 2 digits.  Numeric digits were given a leading zero.  For example, the digit 2 would be converted to 02.  Letters would be converted by the ordinal of the letter plus ten.  For example, A would be converted to 11, B to 12, C to 13 and so on.  It is possible to identify individuals in different survey years within the same decade.IPUMS-SESTAT has set PERSONID as a character string for statistical packages to more easily read in the values.Users should note that some respondents are interviewed over time, allowing the possibility for longitudinal data analysis.  Please see our User Note on Longitudinal Data.|Technical
REFID|Reference ID number (original)|Technical|REFID is the original individual reference number constructed by the NSF to identify respondents across surveys.  Some cohorts have alphabetic characters in addition to numeric characters, so IPUMS created an entirely numeric version called PERSONID.  Users should note that some respondents are interviewed over time, allowing the possibility for longitudinal data analysis.  Please see our User Note on Longitudinal Data.|Technical
YEAR|Survey year|Technical|YEAR gives the year in which the survey was administered.|Technical
WEIGHT|SESTAT weight|Technical|WEIGHT is a weight variable specific to SESTAT samples. The original weights for the separate, non-SESTAT surveys were adjusted to create WEIGHT, so that individuals who might have been eligible for more than one survey are not over-represented when analyzing the entire SESTAT file for a particular year.  Users should use WTSURVY for non-SESTAT survey samples.The original data includes the decimal point and 2 decimal places.|Technical
SAMPLE|Sample identifier|Technical|SAMPLE is an IPUMS-design sample identification number to distinguish each SESTAT sample uniquely.  The sample coding convention is as follows: the left-most digit (or two digits in 4-digit codes) sequentially numbers each iteration of survey waves beginning in 1993, the second from the right digit identifies SESTAT samples with 0, and non-SESTAT (full survey) samples with 1, and the right-most digit corresponds to the survey type, for example, SDR samples have a last digit of 2.|Technical
SURID|Survey identifier|Technical|SURID identifies the survey for which the respondent was interviewed in this particular survey year.|Technical
COHORT|Survey cohort|Technical|COHORT identifies to which survey cohort the respondent belongs.  For the National Survey of College Graduates (NSCG), a cohort is selected from the decennial Census or the American Community Survey sample at the beginning of each decade, and the cohort is followed over the decade.  New waves of respondents are selected by different sampling methods for the National Survey of Recent College Graduates (NSRCG) and the Survey of Doctorate Recipients (SDR) every 2 to 3 years.  The SDR respondents are not interviewed again, but the NSRCG respondents are pooled with the NSCG of that decade and interviewed until the end of the decade.  See our User Notes on Sample Design or Longitudinal Data for more details.|Technical
SRVMODE|Survey mode|Technical|SRVMODE describes the way in which the respondent was interviewed for the survey.|Technical
SEQNUM|Sequence number|Technical|SEQNUM is a variable constructed by IPUMS that preserves the original order of records within each sample in the public use files.  The sequence number is assigned independently for each survey component of SESTAT files.|Technical
AGE|Age|Demographic|AGE is a public use version of the respondent's age at the time of the survey.  In most samples, AGE is top-coded at 75 and bottom-coded at 23, 27, or 35.For SESTAT samples in the years 1993 to 1999, AGE is a recode using the variable BIRYR, which is the respondent's birth year, given in 5-year intervals.  The result is that AGE is also given in 5-year intervals, because the recode subtracts the value in BIRYR from the survey year.|Demographic
BIRYR|Birth year|Demographic|BIRYR reports the respondent's year of birth within 5-year interval groups. For samples in years 2001 and onward, BIRYR is calculated by subtracting the respondent's age in AGE from the survey year, and recoded to match the 5-year interval scheme.|Demographic
